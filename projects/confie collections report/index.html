The goal of this project was to develop a Tableau dashboard to visualize several call center KPI such as: average handle time, number of calls, answered calls, unanswered calls, etc. in a single unified dashboard, it was important to see information from the accounts they were reaching. Given the nature of the data, they had different sources. The first challenge was to integrate all of this data into an unified view, this is where I shined: I am pretty good at SQL :) and Tableau too.</p> <pre><code class="language-mermaid">graph LR

It was a lot of effort to integrate all the data together.</p> <h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2> <p>The outcome was a practical and beautiful Tableau dashboard, where they could just take a look at the dashboard and see where they are at, this saved a lot as they were doing this with manual weekly reports. They were also able to identify top and bottom performers.</p> <p>The data set served as a source for other projects and analysis.</p> </body></html>
