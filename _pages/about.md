Coming from a biomedical sciences engineering degree, I have experience working with biomedical signals and I have very strong problem solving skills. By the time I was finishing the bachelor of science in biomedical engineering, I found a passion in Physical Therapy.

I always liked movement and exercise and help people, and I decided to pursue a career as a Physical Therapist. Unfortunately It didn't fulfill me, I was craving something where I could solve more meaningful and challenging problems and have a bigger impact, that's when I found Data Science. I self taught tableau, SQL and python and I managed to land a role as a Data Analyst at Confie; I worked there from February of 2023 to July 2024 and after this I moved to North Carolina. I couldn't hold my position at Confie, but as a person who always tries to move forward I decided to pursue other opportunities while trying to move forward with my career. I applied to the Online Master of Analytics at Georgia Institute of Technology and I was accepted. In the meantime I worked part-time roles as a barista (I love coffee!) and front desk at a Brazilian Jiujitsu Gym (I also love brazilian jiujitsu!). In February of 2025 I started working at the University of North Carolina as a Research Data Analyst, working primarily with MEA readings from neurons.

I wish to pursue a career as a Data Scientist within biotech or healthcare.
