Coming from a biomedical sciences engineering degree, I have experience working with biomedical signals and I have very strong problem solving skills. After getting my biomedical degree I wanted to pursue a career within healthcare as a Physical Therapist. It didn't fulfill me, I was craving something where I could put my analytical skills to use; that's were I found Data Science. I self taught tableau, SQL and python and my journey began.
